      <h3>WELCOME TO MY POSTERS.</h3>
<p>As you will see the first 3 orange pages are by way of introduction.</p>

<p>The first one is the 'title page' - <b>'POSTERS FOR SCHOOLS'</b></p>
<p><b>SUNREACH</b> is an acronym which both describes the poster (and the book)'s purpose, at the same time as giving a hint of the joy and growth which over time (and perhaps with other therapeutic interventions) this way of working and understanding can offer both staff and recovering vulnerable children - <b>WHEN THE 'SUN' REACHES THEM!</b></p>
<p>The second page offers an introduction to the how and why of the posters. It also explains the Key on the bottom orange strap line of each poster. As you will see, within each poster are a few appropriate links to chapters, pages and boxes in the book where you can find more detail, examples and suggestions. It also lists the poster titles. You will see that each poster’s (small white) number is on the top left-hand corner.</p>
<p>The third page gives a few suggestions of ways to use the posters.</p>
<p>You will see that there is also a PowerPoint of the posters which some school staff and trainers may want to use (or dip into), for training sessions.</p>
      <p><b>ENJOY!</b></p>
