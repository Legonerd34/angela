      <h1>Safe to Learn Course</h1>
        <h2>Safe to Learn Course - Origins</h2>
        <p>In liaison with Dr. Tina Axup and colleagues from the Educational Psychology service, I was asked to write and help facilitate the original ‘Safe to Learn’ course by Southend Borough Council as part of their Nurture initiative in 2014. It was delivered free to all interested staff over a period of 3 years with the support of local school counsellors and inclusion teams. It continues to be delivered to Southend schools by request.</p>
        <h2>Notes for presenters</h2>
        <p>As you will see below I have included 2 versions of the <b>'Safe to Learn’ </b>course.</p> 

<p>The first version is a recorded version of the introduction to the course and the first seven sessions.</p>
<NavLink to="/1-7">Safe to learn recorded versions 1-7.</NavLink>
<p>The second version is just teh 8 ppt presentations without any commentary. <br />To open and download a session:</p> 
<li>double click on the grey download bar </li>
<li>double click on the presentation which takes you to a black page</li>
<li>double click the blue download button, then on the next page</li> 
<li>double click on ‘download anyway’.</li> 
<p>This downloads the presentation into your downloads folder and you can then access it in the usual way. It includes an introductory ppt as well as the ppt sessions 1 - 7.</p>
<p>Some PowerPoint presentations include short video clips. When a presentation includes
video clip(s), ensuring that you have downloaded them onto your computer before you start
the presentation, will enable them to open automatically on the slides.</p>
<p>To access the <b>recorded versions</b> of sessions 1-7 (no introductory ppt is recorded) just click <NavLink to="/1-7">here</NavLink> or on the Safe to learn 1-7 recorded versions grey bar below the <b>STL Course - Session Titles</b>.</p>
<p> The Session Handouts for each session are listed below, and can be downloaded by clicking on the coloured bars, and sent out to participants before each session.</p>
<h2>‘Book version’ of the ‘Safe to Learn’ course</h2>
<p>Below are the 7 PowerPoint presentations of the ‘Book version’ of the 8 session ‘Safe to Learn’ course - which is included as an eResource on the Book webpage. Session 8 has no ppt presentation as it is a time for course participants to share their completed Pupil Profiles in small groups. The blank pupil profile form and related support materials are included in the support materials below.</p>
<p>I have downloaded this course onto my website (www.angelagreenwood.net) for school and university trainers to access and deliver for free. I have done this because I know how strapped schools and even universities can be for cash in these austere times - making funding for this sort of very important training for their staff (and trainee teachers / SENCOs / teacher assistants / and inclusion staff) very difficult. </p>
