  <h2>Educational Psychotherapy Thinking</h2>
  <h3>is based on an understanding of: </h3>
  <li>psychodynamic/psychoanalytical thinking and theory</li>
  <img src="images/CCEsIRCw.jpeg"style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 300px;">
  <li>the interrelationships between a child’s external environments and history, and their inner world of health, genetic factors and fantasy</li>
  <li>the child in the context of the family</li>
  <li>parental mental health, losses,  family dynamics</li>
  <li>children’s emotional growth and development   </li>
  <li>the links between attachment theory, attunement, the development of a secure base, curiosity and learning</li>
  <li>learning, behaviour and the 3 insecure attachment patterns</li>
  <li>the child in the context of the school    </li>
  <li>the need for emotional containment both at home and at school – in order that a child can internalise their own capacity for emotional containment and resilience</li>
  <li>the links between the lack of emotional containment and the need for defences</li>

  <li>neuroscience – the effect of early damage,  trauma and neglect on the developing brain, and the triggering of fight/flight behaviours</li>
  <li>the emotional aspects of learning and teaching ……including some understanding of: the learning process, inhibitions and risk taking,</li>
  <li>an understanding of the teacher or LSA as educational attachment figure</li>
  <li>an understanding of the role of the task</li>
  <li>an understanding of emotional factors in  difficulties with endings, transitions and new beginnings</li>
  <li>the health giving value of creativity, symbolic play and metaphor within a secure trusted relationship and place</li>
  <h3>Educational psychotherapy acknowledges:</h3>
  <img src="images/99ezilVY.jpeg"style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 300px;">
  <li>that a child’s behaviour, particularly repeated  behaviours and including learning behaviours can have meaning, and can be like an unconscious  communication or cry for help – which benefits from thoughtful reflection and understanding, as well as firm boundaries.</li>
  <li>that children’s behaviour can evoke strong feelings  and reactions in adults</li>
  <li>that ‘disturbed children’ can ‘press our buttons’, and we need to be aware of unconsciously colluding with their dysfunctional tendencies.</li>

  <li>that some children may need opportunities for localised regression</li>
  <h3>Educational Psychotherapy takes into account:</h3>
  <li>careful observation and attention to repeated patterns, including attachment patterns and triggers</li>
  <img src="images/iStock-1133371286.jpeg"style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 300px;">
  <li>the metaphorical content of the child’s expressive work</li>
  <li>our developing understanding of the child’s inner world</li>
  <li>the therapeutic relationship, and the feelings evoked by the child</li>
  <li>thinking about the external environment and the child's inner world</li>
  <li>changes both at home and at school – especially new beginnings, transitions and endings</li>
