      <h2>Clinic Work</h2>
      <p>(Most of my experience is with primary children, or with pre school children in the context of their families, although I have worked with adolescents)
Educational psychotherapy is particularly suitable for children with learning blocks and difficulties due to emotional factors, although these days I find myself working mostly with children with severe emotional and behavioural difficulties in the context of their schools and families. The therapy works in the metaphor using stories, play, art, drama music etc, and takes strong account of transference factors.</p>
<li>To begin with a detailed assessment of the child will be undertaken in the context of the family. School factors will also be considered.</li>
<li>Careful consideration will be given to the planning of practical details and support surrounding the therapy, Is the therapy to be long or short term? </li>
<li>A consistent reliable room in a safe setting will be arranged, along with  regular weekly sessions, at the same time and place each week.</li>
<li>Understanding and good management of boundaries will be crucial.</li>
<li>The therapeutic contract will include reviews with parents (of younger children), and perhaps liaison and reviews with other professionals</li>
<li>Parallel counselling with parents, and perhaps other types of parallel work, is strongly recommended.</li>
<h3>Work with Parents</h3>
<li>Assessment and review meetings with parents or parent and child.</li>
<li>Therapeutic Parenting Support - helpful for long-term foster or adoptive parents. It is particularly helpful to initiate this preventatively, before the problems start, with children with ‘reactive attachment disorder’.</li>
<li>Therapeutic work with parent(s) and child together using the Dan Hughes ‘Attachment focused family therapy’ process</li>
<li>Therapeutic play sessions with parent and child(ren) together can be particularly helpful for pre-school children, fostering attunement, and thoughtful understanding and responsiveness to behavioural communications .</li>
<li>Theraplay (attachment based play) with mother and child together can be helpful in cases where there are attachment difficulties, and the mother is open to working with and thinking about the unmet ‘baby needs’ of the child.</li>
<h4>Assesments</h4>
<p>Educational Psychotherapy assessments of children's emotional difficulties linked into their learning and/or behavioural difficulties in school, and/or their home situations and history.</p>
