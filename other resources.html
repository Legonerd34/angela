<h3>Books which touch on emotional issues children may identify with</h3>
<p>As an educational psychotherapist, and also as a primary school teacher I would regularly
  read evocative stories to children.
  Infant and junior teachers, learning mentors, teacher assistants and child counsellors and
  psychotherapists may also read such stories to and with children, both to enjoy together,
  and perhaps to open up conversations about themes they might identify with.
  For vulnerable, hurt and hurting children this can be a safe way to think about issues and
  situations “at once removed”; situations they might have been affected by; without actually
  acknowledging their own scary or uncomfortable experiences.
  Below is a list of such stories, many of which I personally used with children in therapy, and
  which I and they particularly valued. I have put them into categories for ease of access.
  I made this list many years ago however and some of them may be out of print, but used
  copies may be still available on the internet. The value of such stories however still stands.
  The list would always benefit from revision of course, as excellent new books are coming
  out all the time!!</p>
