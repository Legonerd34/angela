    <p>'Understanding, Nurturing and Working Effectively with Vulnerable Children in Schools' offers a comprehensive and accessible exploration of the difficulties faced by teachers and schools from at-risk and disaffected children, including repeated trauma and insecure attachment patterns. It includes practical suggestions, numerous case examples and teacher friendly theoretical background material as

    well as a wealth of ideas for ways forward, including differentiated responses to children in the light of their

    particular patterns, developmental stages and unmet needs. Written from extensive professional experience, this is an essential handbook and resource book.</p>
    <p>The book describes how a thoughtful ‘relationship based’ approach, which understands behaviour as unconscious communication and sets firm boundaries with empathy and thoughtfulness, can slowly alleviate such difficulties. Offering a second chance more secure attachment experience can enable students to discover it might be safe to let down their all consuming defences a little, freeing them to begin to learn. It offers teacher friendly theory e.g. understanding attachment patterns, and unconscious processes which happen all the time in school. It includes:</p>
    <li>Practical suggestions in note form – making them easy to use, refer to and assimilate</li>
    <li>Numerous case examples and teacher friendly theoretical background material</li>
    <li>A wealth of ideas for ways forward, including differentiated responses to children in the light of their particular patterns, developmental stages and unmet needs</li>
    <p>Written from extensive professional experience, this is an essential handbook and resource book for trainers, schools, teachers and school staff, and for educational psychologists and those in children’s services working with vulnerable children in pre and primary schools, as well as those in special schools and units.</p>
    <p>It is a resource book and handbook for teachers, school staff, teacher trainers, psychologists etc. and all those working with vulnerable children and with staff involved with them.

    <h3>Reviews</h3>
    <p>"This book is timely! Positive relationships are at the heart of all good teaching and learning; they allow us to reach out to our learners, to understand them, form strong connections and create the learning environment they need to flourish. Angela draws on her professional expertise and extensive experience to give clear explanations, examples and pertinent case studies, all grounded in relevant theory, which enlighten those who have important work to do in supporting our most vulnerable learners; children who require especially fine and considered attunement from the adults who work with them. As a teacher educator I consider this to be an important book to deepen understanding of the issues in relation to attachment while providing a wealth of material to use with our student teachers."</p>
    <h3>–Rosie Moore, Senior Lecturer, School of Education, University of Brighton</h3>
    <p>"In light of the ongoing debate around exclusions and the increase in mental health issues, the release of this book is extremely timely. It will help professionals to reframe their understanding of behaviour and what children and young people might be communicating through it. The book is grounded in accessible theory with illustrative examples showing how these relate to practice. In addition, Angela Greenwood provides readers with realistic and effective strategies to help them engage with and support the children and young people in their care."</p>
    <h3>–Michael Surr, Education Development Officer and editor of nasen Connect, nasen (National Association of Special Educational Needs)</h3>
    <p>"Angela Greenwood has captured here, in one volume, all the most compelling and salient psycho-dynamically-informed approaches and strategies for supporting children and young people in education settings. This work is replete with examples of how attachment theory and associated perspectives may inform how teachers, learning support assistants and other educational professionals can provide the optimal conditions for children to feel safe, to learn and to flourish. This book will, no doubt, make a significant impact on school staff, school systems, organisational structures within education, and, most vitally, on the children and families they serve."</p>
    <h3>–Nicole Schnackenberg, Educational Psychologist and author of False Bodies, True Selves: Moving Beyond Appearance-Focused Identity Struggles and Returning to the True Self</h3>
    <p>"This book is a summary of what all teachers should understand and practice if we are to help all children to learn. It describes the implications of early social and emotional childhood experience for later behaviour and responses in the classroom and relates this to teaching practice and delivery. An essential read for all education staff."</p>

    <h2>Taking Children Seriously: Applications of Counselling and Therapy in Education (Cassell Studies in Pastoral Care & Personal & Social Education)</h2>
    <img src="images/book2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 200px;">
    <p>In times of great change and development in the education system, those children who experience difficulties in school because they are emotionally troubled are particularly vulnerable. Increasingly, schools are under pressure to produce results which appear good in the public domain, and so can feel forced to spend money on activities designed to enhance public reputation, consequently neglecting those pupils who are difficult to teach because they are emotionally disturbed.</p> <br>Taking Children Seriously has been written by those trained and working in this field to provide insights into how to apply ideas and theories taken from psychotherapy and counselling to the context of education. The authors demonstrate to practising teachers approaches for working with feelings in the classroom and provide ideas which schools may wish to consider to supplement their present work with special needs pupils. Steve Decker is a Chartered Psychologist and Head of Counselling <br>Division at Anglia Polytechnic University. Sandy Kirby is a counsellor and Professional Tutor at a London comprehensive. Angela Greenwood is an educational therapist and special needs co-ordinator who has worked in Britain and Zambia in the primary and pre-school sectors. Dudley moore is a counsellor and former headteacher of a special school. All four editors are founders of the Counselling and Therapy Service for Schools.
